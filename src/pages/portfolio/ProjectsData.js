  title: "Multi-Lane Speed Measurement Edge Module with License Plate",
  category: "Electronics & Telecommunication",
  subcategory: "Electronics Projects",
  description: `
  This project aims to develop an edge module suitable for road speed enforcement in Sri Lanka. Existing systems tailored for large highways are not a good fit due to the lack of lane discipline on Sri Lankan roads, and the high quantity of small vehicles such as motorbikes and three-wheelers. 
  We are developing a low-cost speed enforcement module that addresses these concerns, and displays the speed and license plate of vehicles in real-time to provide a visual deterrent against overspeeding.
  Real-time license plate recognition is achieved by implementing quantized neural networks on an FPGA using Xilinx FINN and Brevitas frameworks. 
  Speed estimation is done using a 77 GHz millimeter-wave radar sensor from Texas Instruments. The speed and license plate data are fused using a data fusion module implemented on the FPGA.
